Description: From R 4.5.0, the 'datasets' package includes the `penguins` and 
    `penguins_raw`, data sets popularised in the 'palmerpenguins' package.
    'basepenguins' takes files that use the 'palmerpenguins' package and 
    converts them to work with the versions from 'datasets' (R >= 4.5.0). 
    It does this by removing calls to `library(palmerpenguins)` and making the 
    necessary changes to column names. Additionally, it provides helper 
    functions to define new files paths for saving the output, and a directory
    of example files to experiment with.
